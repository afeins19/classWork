# Naming Conventions

### Directories
directories should be named using lowercase titles (for single words) or camelCase for mutli-word titles. Always have the first word be in lowercase. 

### Python 
**python files/models will be be titled using PEP-8 guidlines:**
- **File Names:** Lowercase with Underscores: File names should be lowercase, with words separated by underscores as necessary to improve readability. For example, my_module.py is preferable over Mymodule.py or myModule.py.

- **Executable Scripts:** For executable Python scripts (scripts meant to be run as the main program rather than imported as a module), it's common to omit the .py extension and use a shebang line at the top of the file (e.g., #!/usr/bin/env python3) to indicate the script's interpreter.

### C/C++ 
- **File Names:** use lowercase with underscores for file names and keep this consistent
