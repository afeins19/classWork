/*


You are tasked with evaluating the performance of three different deterministic CPU scheduling algorithms: First-Come-First-Served (FCFS), Shortest Job First (SJF), and Priority scheduling. The evaluation will be based on their impact on waiting time and throughput in a multi-tasking operating system environment with specific deterministic process arrival time and burst time.

A set of processes with specific deterministic arrival times and burst times

arrival times {0, 1, 2, 3, 4} and burst times {4, 3, 2, 5, 1}. 

priority for a priority scheduling {1,3,5,2,4}

        Tasks:

1. Calculate Average waiting time for each scheduling algorithm

2. Calculate throughput for each scheduling algorithm

3. Discuss your results

You can either manually calculate or develop a code for this while you need to include the procedure for manual calculation or code for code-based evaluation.
