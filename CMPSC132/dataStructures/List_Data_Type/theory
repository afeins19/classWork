Linked List implementation:

It is important to note that the location of the first item of the list must be explicitly specified.
Once we know where the first item is, the first item can tell us where the second is, and so on.
The external reference is often referred to as the head of the list. Similarly,
the last item needs to know that there is no next item.

Nodes:

The basic building block for the linked list implementation is the node.
Each node object must hold at least two pieces of information.
First, the node must contain the list item itself.
